  <h3>Who's Your Idol?</h3>
  <span><img id="profile-pic" src="img/profile-pic.png"/></span>
  My name is Laurence.  Some people call me “Idol.”  I’m solution-oriented.  And through patience and originality, i tend to come up with solutions.  Then I would ask undeniably, “Who’s your idol?”  On a more serious note, I like to contribute significantly to history.  Like I did when I served in the US military to spread freedom around the world, as a US Navy veteran.  I'm also looking forward to do something significant for the world through software development.  I’ve been wanting to work on and build android applications.  And I like having fun.  It's exciting, because the possibilities is limitless.
